-- nHr as the number of solutions in non-negative integral sum equation
How many solutions are there in this equation?
x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = r where x_i>=0, r>=0 are integers
The question is equivalent to:
To divide r balls (in a line) into n regions (can be empty), how many ways can we do that?

Example 1:
o|oo|ooo
It has divides r=6 balls into n=3 regions, which corresponds to the solution
(1, 2, 3) in x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6

Example 2:
||o|ooo|||oooo
It has divides r=8 balls into n=7 regions, which corresponds to the solution
(0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 4) in x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 = 8


-- General Solution
To solve it generally, we can reform the question into this:
How many solutions are there in this equation?
(x_1 + 1) + (x_2 + 1) + ... + (x_n + 1) = r + n where x_i>=0, r>=0 are integers
or, equivalently, this:
y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_n = r + n where y_i>=1, r>=0 are integers

Now, this is equivalent to divide (r+n) balls (in a line) into n regions (MUST NOT be empty)
In other words, we need to place (n-1) bars between balls, and there are (r+n-1) places to choose

So, nHr = (r+n-1)C(n-1)

-- Use nHr to solve repeatable choice problem
Another application on nHr is the "repeatable choice problem".

Suppose there are n types of alphabet, and r boxes to be filled in. (Alphabets reusable/omittable. Order does not matter.)
If we restrict that the alphabets are not reusable, then the answer is surely nCr
But what if we accept reusing alphabets?
Then, we are actually dividing r boxes into n regions!
Thus, the answer is nHr

Let us take an example to explain this:
Suppose there are n=6 alphabets, ABCDEF, and r=4 boxes, 1234, to be filled in. (Alphabets reusable/omittable. Order does not matter.)
Consider a possible output CCAD, it is equivalent to ACCD since order does not matter.
Then we can express ACCD as dividing 1234 into 6 regions
1||23|4||
Region A contains 1
Region B contains nothing
Region C contains 2,3
...

One should note that, n<r, n=r, n>r are possible cases.

-- Summary:
1) nHr is equivalent to:
(i)
Number of solutions in:
x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = r where x_i>=0 are integers
given r>=0 is an integer

(ii) 
Number of ways that:
n alphabets are chosen into r boxes. Alphabets reusable/omittable. Order does not matter.

(iii)
Number of ways that:
r balls in a line are divided into n regions, regions can be empty

(iv) (This case can be solved by C easily, don't need to memorize it)
r+n balls in a line are divided into n regions, regions can NOT be empty

2) nHr can be evaluated to
(i) (n-1) bar placed into (r+n-1) spaces
(r+n-1)C(n-1)

(ii) For easier calculation,
(r+n-1)Cr

Q1:
5 identical lights are supposed to have 1 of 3 colors -- red, green or blue
An engineer is making test cases that only care about the NUMBER of colors
How many test cases are there?

Q2:
How many integral solutions are there in:
x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_9 = 100 where x_i >= i

Q1Ans:
This is equivalent to solve 
r + g + b = 5
thus r=5, n=3
3H5 = (3+5-1)C5 = 7C5 = 21 cases

alternative:
This is also equivalent to writing alphabets r,g,b into 5 boxes. (Alphabets reusable/omittable. Order does not matter.)
So, 3 alphabets is chosen into 5 boxes, repeatable.
3H5=21 cases

alternative:
Arrange 5 lights in a line,
and restrict that the order must be all reds, then all greens, then all blues.
That means, no red lights after green lights, and no green lights after blue lights.
Then we can divide 5 lights in line into 3 regions, which gives out 3H5=21

Q2Ans:
let y_i = x_i - i, it is a bijection of course,
then the equation becomes
y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_9 = 55 where y_i >=0

Thus, the answer is 55H9
(55+9-1)C9, find it by calculator
